# Exercise 2: Using Streamlit Session State

# Goal: Implement a simple counter that increments when a button is clicked.
# Use st.session_state to store the counter value between reruns.

st.title("Exercise 2: Session State Counter")

# --- Your code starts here ---

# TODO: Initialize the counter in session state if it doesn't exist.
# Set its initial value to 0.

# TODO: Create a button labeled "Increment".

# TODO: If the button is clicked, increment the counter value in session state.

# TODO: Display the current counter value from session state.

# --- Your code ends here ---

# Example usage (this part is for context, replace with your implementation)
# if "counter" not in st.session_state:
#     st.session_state.counter = 0
#
# if st.button("Increment Example"):
#     st.session_state.counter += 1
#
# st.write(f"Current Count (Example): {st.session_state.counter}")


# To run: streamlit run exercise02.py
